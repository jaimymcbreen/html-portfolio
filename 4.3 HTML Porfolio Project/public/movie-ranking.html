<h1>Top 3 Movies</h1>

<h2>The top 3 films according to me.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Empire Strikes Back</h3>
    <p>This is the pinnacle of Star Wars. The stage has already been set and the characters develop more than in the first movie. Plus, Boba Fett.
    </p>
<h3>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</h3>
    <p>This is always a toss-up between Raiders and Last Crusade. I think this one wins by a hair. It has Sean Connery and that cool Templar guy.

<h3>Scott Pilgrim Vs the World</h3>
    <p>Scott Pilgrim is just a ton of fun. Comic books, music and video games all rolled into one kickass movie.</p>
